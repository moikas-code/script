## Critical Missing Features 

### ðŸŽ“ BLOCKING for Educational Use (Teaching Programming)
1. **Generics**: Cannot parse `fn identity<T>(x: T) -> T` - students would be confused
2. **Memory Safety**: Memory leaks from circular references - unreliable for learning
3. **Module System**: Multi-file projects fail - can't teach larger program structure
4. **Error Handling**: No Result/Option types - can't teach proper error handling
5. ~~**Pattern Matching**: Object patterns incomplete~~ âœ… COMPLETED with full safety

### ðŸš€ BLOCKING for Production Use (Building Real Applications)

#### Core Language Requirements
1. **Memory Safety**: Memory leaks make applications unreliable in production
2. **Performance**: 3x slower than target - not acceptable for production workloads  
3. **Error Handling**: No Result/Option types - applications will crash unexpectedly
4. **Async/Await**: Non-functional - can't build web servers or concurrent applications
5. **Module System**: Multi-file projects fail - can't build large applications
6. **Generics**: Cannot build reusable libraries without generic types
7. **Standard Library**: Missing HashMap, file I/O, networking - can't build real apps
8. **FFI**: Cannot integrate with existing C/Rust libraries
9. **Debugger**: Cannot debug production issues without proper tooling
10. **Package Registry**: Cannot distribute or consume third-party packages

19. **Template Engine**: No HTML templating - can't generate dynamic pages
20. **WebSocket Support**: No real-time communication - can't build modern web apps

#### Game Development
