# Script Language Implementation Status

## Version: 0.9.0-beta

This document tracks the actual implementation status of the Script programming language. 

## Overall Completion: ~75%

### Phase 1: Lexer âœ… Complete (100%)
- [x] Tokenization with all operators and keywords
- [x] Unicode support for identifiers and strings
- [x] Source location tracking
- [x] Error recovery and reporting
- [x] Comprehensive test suite

- [x] Basic type checking

**Known Issues:**
- Generics partially scaffolded but not functional
- Advanced type inference cases not handled
- Trait system not implemented

### Phase 4: Semantic Analysis ðŸ”§ 80% Complete

- [ ] **Pattern exhaustiveness checking**
- [ ] **Guard implementation**
- [x] Forward reference handling
- [x] Module system basics

**Known Issues:**

- Pattern matching generates suboptimal code

### Phase 6: Runtime ðŸ”§ 75% Complete
- [x] Basic value representation
- [x] Function call support
- [x] Reference counting (ARC)
- [ ] **Cycle detection**
- [x] Basic garbage collection
- [ ] **Async runtime**
- [x] Error handling
- [x] Basic profiler

**Known Issues:**
- Memory cycles can leak
- No weak references
- Async/await not implemented

### Phase 7: Standard Library ðŸš§ 60% Complete
- [x] Core types (numbers, strings, booleans)
- [x] Basic I/O (print, read)
- [x] Collections (arrays, basic operations)
- [ ] **HashMap/Set implementations**
- [ ] **File I/O**
- [ ] **Network I/O**
- [ ] **Async primitives**
- [x] Math functions

**Known Issues:**
- Limited collection methods
- No async support
- Missing many common utilities

### Phase 8: Developer Tools ðŸ”§ 70% Complete
- [x] REPL with token/parse modes
- [x] Basic CLI interface
- [ ] **LSP server** (partial implementation)
- [ ] **Debugger** (scaffolded, not functional)
- [ ] **Package manager** (manuscript - basic design)
- [x] Error reporting with source context
- [ ] **Documentation generator**

**Known Issues:**
- LSP missing many features
- Debugger cannot set breakpoints
- No package registry

## Critical Missing Features for 1.0

1. **Pattern Matching Safety**: No exhaustiveness checking makes pattern matching unsafe
2. **Generics**: Parser and type system don't support generics despite AST definitions
3. **Memory Safety**: No cycle detection in ARC implementation
4. **Async/Await**: Keywords exist but no implementation
5. **Module System**: Import/export parsing exists but resolution incomplete
6. **Error Handling**: No Result/Option types or try/catch
7. **Testing Framework**: No built-in test runner or assertions

## Test Coverage

- Lexer: ~90% coverage with comprehensive tests
- Parser: ~70% coverage, missing generic and pattern tests  
- Type System: ~60% coverage, inference tests incomplete
- Semantic: ~50% coverage, cross-module tests failing
- Codegen: ~40% coverage, mostly integration tests
- Runtime: ~60% coverage, memory safety tests needed
- Stdlib: ~30% coverage, many modules untested

## Performance Status

Current benchmarks show:
- Lexing: Competitive with similar languages
- Parsing: 20% slower than target due to allocations
- Type Checking: Needs optimization for large programs
- Runtime: 3x slower than native, expected for interpreter
- Memory Usage: Higher than expected, needs profiling

## Documentation Status

- Language Specification: ~60% complete
- API Documentation: ~40% complete
- User Guide: ~70% complete
- Developer Guide: ~50% complete
- Tutorial: Not started

## Recommended Version Strategy

Based on semantic versioning and actual completion:

- **Current**: 0.9.0-beta (most features present but incomplete)
- **Next Milestone**: 0.9.5 (pattern matching safety, basic generics)
- **Release Candidate**: 0.9.9-rc (all features complete, testing)
- **1.0 Release**: When all critical features work correctly

## How to Track Progress

This file should be updated as features are completed. Each feature should include:
- Implementation status
- Test coverage
- Known limitations
- Performance metrics
