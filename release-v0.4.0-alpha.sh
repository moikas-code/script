git commit -m "🚀 Release v0.4.0-alpha: Generic Parameter Parsing Complete

✅ Major Features Completed:
- Pattern matching safety with exhaustiveness checking (Issue #1) FULLY COMPLETE
- Generic parameter parsing with 26 test cases (Issue #2) PARSER COMPLETE
- Support for trait bounds: T: Clone, T: Clone + Debug, etc.
- Error recovery and helpful error messages

🛠️ Technical Achievements:
- parse_generic_parameters() function fully implemented
- Comprehensive AST support for generic parameters  
- 26 passing test cases for all generic scenarios
- Updated documentation and release notes

📚 Documentation:
- Updated KNOWN_ISSUES.md with accurate current status
- Created comprehensive v0.4.0-alpha release notes
- Version bump from v0.3.0-alpha → v0.4.0-alpha

🎯 Educational Impact:
- Safe pattern matching (prevents runtime crashes)
- Generic function signatures parse correctly
- Ready for teaching generic programming concepts

🔄 Next Phase: Type system integration for complete generic support
Issues Resolved: #1 (FULLY), #2 (PARSER COMPLETE)"
