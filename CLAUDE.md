# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with the Script programming language repository.

- Format each individual memory as a bullet point and group related memories under descriptive markdown headings.

- Perform a web search if you need more information

- Create a Task in the KB when making a plan to keep track between sessions

- Never use placeholder logic when writing logic; provide a full solution

## Project Overview
**Script Language v0.5.0-alpha** - AI-native programming language with production-grade generics, pattern matching, memory cycle detection, and **complete functional programming support**. Major systems now complete (~90% overall), with remaining work on error messages, REPL enhancements, and MCP integration.

### Key Architecture Components

**Core Modules:**
- `src/lexer/` - Tokenization with Unicode support âœ…
- `src/parser/` - Recursive descent + Pratt parsing âœ…  
- `src/semantic/` - Type checking, pattern exhaustiveness âœ…
- `src/codegen/` - Cranelift IR generation ðŸ”§
- `src/runtime/` - Memory management, cycle detection ðŸ”§
- `src/mcp/` - AI integration security framework ðŸ”„

### Core Design Principles

1. **Expression-Oriented**: Everything returns a value (if/while/blocks)
2. **Gradual Typing**: Optional type annotations with inference
3. **Memory Safety**: ARC with Bacon-Rajan cycle detection
4. **AI-Native**: Security-first MCP implementation for AI development
5. **Error Recovery**: Multiple error reporting with source context
6. **Performance-First**: O(n log n) type system with union-find unification

## Current Development Focus

### ðŸš¨ Critical Issues (Immediate Priority)
*No critical issues remaining - all major systems complete!*

### âœ… Recently Completed (January 2025)
- **Module System** - Full multi-file project support with import/export
- **Standard Library** - Complete collections (HashMap/Set/Vec), I/O, math, networking
- **Functional Programming** - Closures, higher-order functions, iterators (57 operations)
- **Error Handling** - Result<T,E> and Option<T> with monadic operations
- **Async Security Vulnerabilities** - All use-after-free and memory corruption issues resolved
- **Generic Implementation Security** - Array bounds checking and field access validation
- **Resource Limits** - Comprehensive DoS protection for all compilation phases
- **Type System Complexity** - O(nÂ²) algorithms optimized to O(n log n) with union-find

### ðŸ”§ Active Development
- **Error Messages** - Improving quality and context
- **REPL Enhancements** - Better interactive development experience
- **MCP Security Framework** - AI integration implementation
- **Performance Optimizations** - Further runtime improvements

## Development Workflow

### Quick Start
1. **Check Issues**: Review `kb/KNOWN_ISSUES.md` before starting work
2. **Check Status**: Review `kb/STATUS.md` for current completion status  
3. **Security First**: All external inputs are untrusted, validate everything
4. **Update Docs**: Keep `kb/` documentation current as you work

### Key Development Rules
- **Git Rule**: Never author commits as Claude, always as the user
- **Security Rule**: All MCP tools must use sandboxed analysis
- **Memory Rule**: Runtime safety takes precedence over new features
- **Testing Rule**: Security validation tests are mandatory
- **Resource Rule**: All compilation operations must respect resource limits for DoS protection

### Adding New Token Types
1. Add variant to `TokenKind` enum in `src/lexer/mod.rs`
2. Update `Scanner::scan_token()` in `src/lexer/scanner.rs`
3. Add keyword to `Scanner::get_keyword()` if applicable
4. Add tests in `src/lexer/tests.rs`

### Adding New AST Nodes
1. Add variant to `Expr` or `Stmt` enum in `src/parser/mod.rs`
2. Implement parsing logic in `src/parser/parser.rs`
3. Update `Display` implementations for pretty-printing
4. Add parser tests in `src/parser/tests.rs`

### MCP Security Guidelines

**Core Principles:**
- All MCP tools use sandboxed analysis (non-negotiable)
- All external inputs require validation (untrusted by default)  
- Resource limits enforced at multiple layers (defense in depth)
- Security validation tests mandatory (no exceptions)

**Testing Pattern:**
```rust
// Validate dangerous input rejection
assert!(mcp_server.validate_input(malicious_code).is_err());
// Test resource limits  
assert!(mcp_server.analyze_code(&"x".repeat(1_000_000)).is_err());
```

## Implementation Roadmap

See `./kb/IMPLEMENTATION_TODO.md` for original planning. Current status:
- **[status](./kb/status)**: Detailed completion tracking for all phases

## File Organization

### Directory Structure
- **Root**: Only config files, documentation, build files  
- **tests/**: All test files and fixtures organized by type
- **examples/**: Demo programs and tutorials
- **kb/**: Knowledge base (see KB Organization below)

### Prohibited Root Files
No `.script` files in root directory. Use:
- `tests/fixtures/valid_programs/` for test cases
- `examples/` for demonstrations  
- `tests/mcp/security/` for MCP validation

## KB (Knowledge Base) Organization

The `kb/` directory follows a specific structure for tracking project state:

### KB Directory Structure
```
