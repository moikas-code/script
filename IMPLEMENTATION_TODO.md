## Technical Decisions Made

1. **Implementation Language**: Rust (for memory safety and performance)
2. **Parsing Strategy**: Hand-written recursive descent with Pratt parsing
3. **Memory Model**: Automatic Reference Counting with cycle detection
4. **Type System**: Gradual typing with Hindley-Milner inference
5. **Compilation Strategy**: Dual backend (Cranelift for dev, LLVM for prod)
6. **Error Philosophy**: Multiple errors per compilation, helpful messages
7. **Syntax Style**: JavaScript/GDScript inspired for familiarity

## Open Design Questions

1. **Concurrency Model**: Actor model vs shared memory with safety?
-  Actor model with escape hatches
The actor model aligns perfectly with your philosophy:

Beginners: "Send messages between actors" is intuitive - like passing notes
Games: Natural fit for game entities communicating
Web: Maps well to web workers and async operations
Safety: Eliminates data races by design
```
// Simple actor example
actor Player {
    let x: f32 = 0
    let y: f32 = 0
    
    receive move(dx, dy) {
        x += dx
        y += dy
    }
}

// But allow shared memory for performance-critical paths
unsafe shared {
    let physics_cache = SharedArray<Vec3>()
}
```
2. **Error Handling**: Result types vs exceptions vs panic?
- Result types with syntactic sugar
Results are more explicit and beginner-friendly than exceptions:

No invisible control flow
Errors are values, making them less scary
Can add sugar to reduce boilerplate
```
// Result type approach
fn divide(a: f32, b: f32) -> Result<f32> {
    if b == 0 {
        Err("Division by zero")
    } else {
        Ok(a / b)
    }
}

// With syntactic sugar using ? operator
fn calculate() -> Result<f32> {
    let x = divide(10, 2)?  // Returns early if error
    let y = divide(x, 3)?
    Ok(x + y)
}

// Panic only for unrecoverable errors
assert(index < array.len, "Index out of bounds")
```
3. **Trait/Interface System**: Structural vs nominal typing?
- Structural typing with optional nominal
Structural typing is more beginner-friendly and flexible:

"If it walks like a duck..." is intuitive
No need to explicitly implement interfaces
Natural for JavaScript developers
```
// Structural by default
type Drawable = {
    draw(canvas: Canvas) -> ()
}

// Any type with a draw method works
struct Circle {
    radius: f32
    
    fn draw(canvas: Canvas) {
        // implementation
    }
}

// Optional nominal for when you need it
trait GameEntity {
    fn update(dt: f32)
    fn render()
}

impl GameEntity for Player {
    // explicit implementation
}
```
4. **Macro System**: Include macros or keep language simple?
- No user-defined macros, but built-in metaprogramming
Macros add significant complexity for beginners. Instead:

Provide powerful built-in constructs
Code generation through external tools
Template-like features for common patterns
```
// Built-in derives instead of macros
@derive(Debug, Serialize)
struct Player {
    name: String
    score: i32
}

// Built-in list comprehensions
let doubled = [x * 2 for x in numbers if x > 0]

// External codegen for complex cases
@generate("protobuf", "schema.proto")
```
5. **Package Distribution**: Centralized registry vs decentralized?
- Hybrid approach - start centralized, allow mirrors
Begin with simplicity:

Central registry for discoverability (like npm, crates.io)
Git URLs as escape hatch
Mirror support from day one
```
// manuscript.toml
[dependencies]
web-framework = "1.2.0"  // from registry
game-engine = { git = "https://github.com/user/engine" }
internal-lib = { path = "../libs/internal" }

[registries]
default = "https://manuscript.script-lang.org"
corporate = "https://internal.company.com/manuscript"
```
6. **Compile-time Execution**: Const functions vs compile-time interpreter?
- Const functions with clear boundaries
Simpler than full compile-time interpretation:

Mark functions as @const for compile-time evaluation
Clear rules about what can be const
Useful for configuration and optimization
```
@const
fn calculate_pi(iterations: i32) -> f32 {
    // Can only call other @const functions
    // No I/O, no randomness
    let pi = // ... calculation
    pi
}

// Evaluated at compile time
const PI = calculate_pi(1000000)

// Conditional compilation
@const
fn target_os() -> String {
    // Returns "windows", "macos", "linux", etc.
}

if @const(target_os() == "windows") {
    // Windows-specific code
}
```
## Current Focus (Phase 6: Advanced Features)

With Phase 5 (Runtime & Standard Library) now complete, the focus shifts to advanced language features:

### Next Major Features:

### Runtime Architecture (Planned):
```rust
// Memory management
pub struct ScriptRc<T> {
    ptr: NonNull<RcBox<T>>,
    phantom: PhantomData<RcBox<T>>,
}

struct RcBox<T> {
    strong: Cell<usize>,
    weak: Cell<usize>,
    value: T,
}

// Runtime core
pub struct Runtime {
    memory: MemoryManager,
    panic_handler: PanicHandler,
    gc_threshold: usize,
}

// Standard library types
pub enum ScriptValue {
    I32(i32),
    F32(f32),
    Bool(bool),
    String(ScriptRc<String>),
    Array(ScriptRc<Vec<ScriptValue>>),
    Object(ScriptRc<HashMap<String, ScriptValue>>),
    Function(ScriptRc<Function>),
}
```

*Last Updated: Phase 6 In Progress - Pattern Matching Complete*
*Next Phase: Modules & Packages System*

## Phase 6: Module System Implementation Plan

With pattern matching fully implemented across all language layers, the next major priority is implementing a comprehensive module and package system for Script. This system should be beginner-friendly while supporting modern development practices.

### Design Philosophy

The Script module system follows these principles:
1. **Beginner-Friendly**: Simple, intuitive syntax inspired by familiar languages
2. **Explicit Control**: Clear visibility rules and intentional exports
3. **Path-Based**: Module paths correspond to file system structure
4. **Package-Aware**: Built-in support for external dependencies
5. **Performance-Oriented**: Efficient compilation and resolution

### Syntax Design

Based on research of modern languages (Rust, TypeScript, Python, Go), Script will use:

**Module Declaration:**
```script
// In math/geometry.script
export fn area_circle(radius: f32) -> f32 {
    PI * radius * radius
}

export fn area_rectangle(width: f32, height: f32) -> f32 {
    width * height
}

fn internal_helper() -> i32 {  // Not exported - private to module
    42
}

export const PI = 3.14159
```

**Import Syntax:**
```script
// Single import
import { area_circle } from "./math/geometry"

// Multiple imports  
import { area_circle, area_rectangle, PI } from "./math/geometry"

// Import entire module
import * as geo from "./math/geometry"

// Import with alias
import { area_circle as circle_area } from "./math/geometry"

// External package import
import { Vec2, Vec3 } from "mathlib"
import { http_get } from "web"
```

**Re-export Syntax:**
```script
// In math/mod.script - re-export from submodules
export { area_circle, area_rectangle } from "./geometry"
export { sin, cos, tan } from "./trigonometry"
export * from "./linear_algebra"
```

### Package Manifest Format (`script.toml`)

```toml
[package]
name = "my-game"
version = "0.1.0"
authors = ["Warren Gates <warren@example.com>"]
edition = "2024"
description = "A simple game written in Script"

[dependencies]
mathlib = "1.2.0"
graphics = { version = "2.0", features = ["vulkan"] }
gamedev = { git = "https://github.com/gamedev/script-gamedev" }
internal-utils = { path = "./libs/utils" }

[dev-dependencies]
test-framework = "0.5.0"

[build]
target = "native"  # or "wasm", "cross-platform"
optimization = "release"  # or "debug"
```

### Module Resolution Algorithm

1. **Relative Imports** (`./path` or `../path`):
   - Resolve relative to current file location
   - Look for `.script` files or directories with `mod.script`

2. **Package Imports** (bare specifiers like `"mathlib"`):
   - Check local `script_modules/` directory
   - Fall back to global package cache
   - Download from registry if not found locally

3. **Standard Library** (built-in modules):
   - `std::io`, `std::math`, `std::collections`, etc.
   - Always available without explicit dependencies

### File System Structure

```
my-project/
â”œâ”€â”€ script.toml                 # Package manifest
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ main.script            # Entry point
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ game/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ mod.script         # Module re-exports
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ player.script      # Player module
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ enemies.script     # Enemies module
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ utils/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ math.script        # Utility functions
â”œâ”€â”€ script_modules/            # Local dependencies
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ mathlib/
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ script.toml
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ src/
â””â”€â”€ tests/
    â””â”€â”€ integration_tests.script
```

### Error Handling & Diagnostics

The module system will provide clear error messages for:
- Module not found errors with suggestions
- Circular dependency detection with cycle visualization  
- Import/export mismatch errors
- Version conflict resolution
- Duplicate export errors

### Integration with Existing Systems

- **Type System**: Cross-module type checking and inference
- **Semantic Analysis**: Module-aware symbol resolution
- **Code Generation**: Module boundary handling in IR
- **Standard Library**: Expose stdlib as importable modules
- **REPL**: Support for importing modules in interactive mode

This implementation plan provides a solid foundation for a modern, developer-friendly module system that scales from simple scripts to complex applications while maintaining Script's core philosophy of simplicity and power.
