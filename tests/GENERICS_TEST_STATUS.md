# Generics Test Status Report

## Compilation Issues Found

### Library Compilation Blocked

The `script` library itself has compilation errors that prevent any tests from running:

1. **Missing fields in AST structures**:
   - `where_clause` field missing in multiple pattern matches
   - `generic_param_names` field missing in `AnalysisContext`
   - `target_type` field doesn't exist on `ImplBlock` (it's `type_name`)
   - `is_const` field doesn't exist on `Method`

2. **Missing functions**:
   - `SemanticError::undefined_type` doesn't exist (should be `undefined_export`)

3. **Non-exhaustive pattern matches**:
   - Missing match arms for `StmtKind::Impl` in multiple modules

4. **API mismatches in tests**:
   - `Lexer::new()` takes 1 argument, not 2
   - `scan_all()` method doesn't exist (should be `tokenize()`)
   - Various other incorrect method calls

## Test File Updates Made

### Original Test Issues (tests/end_to_end_generics_test.rs)

The original test file had these problems:
- Referenced non-existent modules (`compilation`, `ir`, `codegen`)
- Used incorrect constructors and APIs
- Tried to test full compilation pipeline that doesn't exist yet

### Updated Test Approach

Created two simplified test files:

1. **tests/end_to_end_generics_test.rs** - Updated to:
   - Only use existing modules (lexer, parser)
   - Test parsing functionality only
   - Comment out tests requiring non-functional components
   - Focus on AST structure verification

2. **tests/generics_parsing_test.rs** - New minimal test file:
   - Tests only lexer and parser
   - Verifies generic syntax is correctly tokenized and parsed
   - Checks AST structure for generic functions, structs, and impl blocks
   - Tests trait bounds parsing

## What Can Be Tested (Once Library Compiles)

1. **Generic Function Parsing**
   - Function declarations with type parameters
   - Type parameter bounds
   - Generic function calls with turbofish syntax

2. **Generic Struct Parsing**
   - Struct declarations with type parameters
   - Generic struct instantiation

3. **Generic Impl Blocks**
   - Impl blocks with type parameters
   - Methods within generic impl blocks

4. **Trait Bounds**
   - Single and multiple bounds
   - Bounds on multiple type parameters

## What Cannot Be Tested

1. **Semantic Analysis** - SemanticAnalyzer has compilation errors
2. **Type Inference** - InferenceEngine not properly integrated
3. **Code Generation** - Module doesn't exist yet
4. **Monomorphization** - Module exists but not integrated
5. **Trait Resolution** - TraitChecker has borrow checker errors

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Fix Library Compilation**:
   - Add missing `where_clause` fields to AST structures
   - Fix method/field name mismatches
   - Add missing match arms for `Impl` variants

2. **Then Run Basic Tests**:
   - Start with `generics_parsing_test.rs` for basic functionality
   - Gradually enable more tests as components are fixed

3. **Integration Path**:
   - Fix semantic analyzer compilation issues
   - Connect monomorphization module to pipeline
   - Implement missing IR and codegen components

## Summary

The generic tests cannot compile because the core library has significant compilation errors. The test files have been updated to use only the actual APIs that exist, but they still cannot run until the library compilation is fixed. The primary issues are structural mismatches in the AST and missing pattern match arms throughout the codebase.
