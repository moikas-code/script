# Documentation Migration Summary

## Date: 2025-01-09

This document summarizes the migration of internal development documentation from `docs/` to `kb/`.

## Migration Rationale

The `docs/` directory contained a mix of user-facing documentation and internal development documents. To maintain clear separation between:
- **User-facing documentation** (API guides, tutorials, language references) → stays in `docs/`
- **Internal development documentation** (implementation plans, status tracking, team reports) → moved to `kb/`

## Files Migrated

### 1. Planning Documents → `kb/planning/`
- `docs/GENERIC_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` → `kb/planning/generics-implementation-plan.md`
- `docs/GENERIC_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` → `kb/planning/generics-implementation-summary.md`

### 2. Development Documents → `kb/development/`
- `docs/GENERIC_PARSER_CHANGES.md` → `kb/development/generics-parser-changes.md`
- `docs/language/USER_DEFINED_TYPES_IMPLEMENTATION.md` → `kb/development/user-defined-types-implementation.md`
- `docs/language/GENERICS_IMPLEMENTATION.md` → `kb/development/generics-implementation-details.md`

### 3. Status Documents → `kb/status/`
- `docs/cross_module_type_checking_status.md` → `kb/status/cross-module-type-checking-status.md`

### 4. Reports → `kb/reports/`
- `docs/team4_final_report.md` → `kb/reports/team4-cross-module-investigation.md`

## Files Kept in `docs/`

These files remain in `docs/` as they are user-facing:
- `docs/type-system-optimization.md` - User guide for optimization features
- `docs/language/GENERICS_SUMMARY.md` - User-facing generics documentation
- All files in `docs/tutorials/`, `docs/development/` (CONTRIBUTING, SETUP, etc.)
- Architecture overviews intended for users (`docs/architecture/`)
- Language references and specifications

## New KB Structure

```
kb/
├── planning/           # Implementation plans and roadmaps
├── development/        # Active development documentation
├── status/            # Implementation status tracking
├── reports/           # Team reports and investigations
├── active/            # Current work items
├── completed/         # Resolved items
├── architecture/      # Internal architecture decisions
└── migration/         # Migration documentation (this file)
```

## Benefits

1. **Clear Separation**: User docs vs internal docs are now clearly separated
2. **Better Organization**: Internal docs organized by purpose (planning, development, status)
3. **MCP Integration**: All internal docs now accessible via MCP tools
4. **Consistency**: Aligns with the kb/ purpose as defined in `kb/architecture/documentation-systems.md`

## Action Items Completed

- [x] Created new subdirectories in `kb/`
- [x] Migrated 7 internal documentation files
- [x] Preserved user-facing documentation in `docs/`
- [x] Updated file names to follow kebab-case convention
- [x] Created this migration summary

## Future Considerations

- Consider automated checks to prevent internal docs in `docs/`
- Update CONTRIBUTING.md to clarify where different docs belong
- Consider creating templates for common kb/ document types
