# Closure System Implementation - Script Language v0.5.0-alpha

## Status: COMPLETED ‚úÖ (2025-01-08)

**Overall Progress**: 100% - Complete closure infrastructure with Script-native support

## Overview

The Script language now has a complete closure system that enables functional programming patterns and seamless integration with Result/Option types. This implementation provides the foundation for advanced error handling and functional programming paradigms.

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: ‚úÖ Core Closure Infrastructure (100% Complete)

**Runtime Support** - `src/runtime/closure.rs`
- `Closure` struct with captured environment
- `ClosureRuntime` for execution management
- Parameter validation and environment setup
- Reference counting for memory safety
- Capture by value and by reference support

**AST Integration** - `src/parser/ast.rs`
- `ExprKind::Closure` variant
- `ClosureParam` structure for parameters
- Type annotation support
- Display implementation for debugging

**Parser Support** - `src/parser/parser.rs`
- `parse_closure_expression` method
- Syntax: `|param1, param2| expression`
- Integration with expression parsing
- Error recovery for malformed closures

### Phase 2: ‚úÖ IR and Code Generation (100% Complete)

**IR Instructions** - `src/ir/instruction.rs`
- `CreateClosure` - Closure instantiation
- `InvokeClosure` - Closure execution
- Parameter and capture tracking
- Type information preservation

**Code Generation** - `src/codegen/cranelift/translator.rs`
- Memory allocation for closure structures
- Function ID storage and retrieval
- Captured variable serialization
- Runtime invocation infrastructure

**Lowering** - `src/lowering/expr.rs`
- AST to IR transformation for closures
- Environment capture analysis
- Type conversion and validation

### Phase 3: ‚úÖ Standard Library Integration (100% Complete)

**Closure Helpers** - `src/stdlib/closure_helpers.rs`
- `ClosureExecutor` for Script-native closure execution
- Type conversion between ScriptValue and Value
- Unary and binary closure execution
- Predicate closure support

**Result/Option Integration**
- Script-native closure methods:
  - `map_closure`, `and_then_closure`, `filter_closure`
  - `inspect_closure`, `inspect_err_closure`
  - `map_err_closure`
- Parallel APIs with existing Rust closure methods
- Seamless type conversions

### Phase 4: ‚úÖ Pattern Matching Completeness (100% Complete)

**All pattern matches implemented for:**
- `Value::Closure` in runtime value handling
- `Instruction::CreateClosure` and `InvokeClosure` in IR processing
- `ExprKind::Closure` in AST operations
- Type inference integration
- Optimization pass support

## Technical Architecture

### Closure Structure
```rust
pub struct Closure {
    pub function_id: String,
    pub captured_vars: HashMap<String, Value>, 
    pub parameters: Vec<String>,
    pub captures_by_ref: bool,
}
```

### Memory Management
- Reference counted (`ScriptRc`) for safe sharing
- Automatic cleanup of captured variables
- Traceable for garbage collection integration
- Efficient memory layout for performance

### Type System Integration
- First-class closure types
- Type inference for parameters and return types
- Generic closure support
- Monomorphization compatibility

## Key Features

1. **Syntax Sugar**: Clean `|x| x + 1` syntax
2. **Environment Capture**: Automatic variable capture with explicit control
3. **Type Safety**: Strong typing with inference support
4. **Performance**: Zero-cost abstractions where possible
5. **Memory Safety**: Reference counting with cycle detection
6. **Functional Programming**: Full monadic operation support

## Integration Points

### Error Handling System
Closures integrate seamlessly with Result/Option types:
```script
let result = some_result
    .map_closure(|x| x * 2)
    .and_then_closure(|x| if x > 10 { Ok(x) } else { Err("too small") });
```

### Standard Library
All functional operations support both Rust and Script closures:
- Backward compatibility maintained
- Performance optimized for Script closures  
- Type conversions handled automatically

### Code Generation
- Efficient closure allocation
- Function pointer management
- Captured variable serialization
