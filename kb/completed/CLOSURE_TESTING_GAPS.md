# Closure Testing Gaps - RESOLVED âœ…

**Status**: RESOLVED âœ…  
**Priority**: HIGH - Production Blocker (RESOLVED)  
**Created**: 2025-07-10  
**Updated**: 2025-07-10  
**Resolved**: 2025-07-10

## Issue Summary

~~The closure implementation is documented as 100% complete, but comprehensive testing analysis reveals significant gaps in test coverage for advanced features. While basic closure functionality is well-tested, critical production features lack proper validation.~~

**UPDATE 2025-07-10**: All identified testing gaps have been addressed with comprehensive implementations and test suites.
