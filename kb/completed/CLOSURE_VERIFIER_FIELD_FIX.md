# Closure Verifier Field Name Fix

**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED  
**Date Created**: 2025-01-10  
**Date Resolved**: 2025-01-10  
**Priority**: LOW

## Summary

Fixed a minor field name mismatch in the closure verifier module that was causing a compilation error.

## Issue Details

### Problem
- **File**: `src/verification/closure_verifier.rs:170`
- **Error**: Attempting to access `closure.name` when the Closure struct actually has a `function_id` field
- **Error Type**: `error[E0609]: no field 'name' on type '&Closure'`

### Root Cause
The closure verifier was written with an incorrect assumption about the Closure struct's field names. The Closure struct uses `function_id` to identify the closure, not `name`.

### Resolution
Changed line 170 from:
```rust
let closure_name = &closure.name;
```

To:
```rust
let closure_name = &closure.function_id;
```

## Impact
- **Severity**: Low - This was a simple field name mismatch
- **Scope**: Limited to the verification module only
- **Fix Time**: Immediate

## Context
This issue was discovered after the main compilation pipeline fixes were completed. The verification module was added as part of the closure runtime enhancements to reach 100% completion, and this minor issue was introduced during that implementation.

## Verification
```bash
$ cargo check
# ✅ No compilation errors
```

**Note**: This issue has been resolved immediately upon discovery. The fix was trivial and the compilation now succeeds.
