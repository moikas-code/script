## üõ†Ô∏è Development Priorities

### Always First
1. **Security** - Every feature must be secure by design
2. **Stability** - No panics, comprehensive error handling
3. **Correctness** - Type safety and memory safety

### Architecture Principles
- **Fail Safe** - Errors never crash the system
- **Defense in Depth** - Multiple security layers
- **Performance Later** - Correctness before speed
- **User First** - Developer experience matters
