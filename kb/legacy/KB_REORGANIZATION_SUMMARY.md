# Knowledge Base Reorganization Summary

**Date**: 2025-01-09  
**Purpose**: Reorganize KB for clarity, production readiness tracking, and SOC2 compliance

## Changes Made

### 1. Created New Directory Structure
```

├── ROADMAP.md                  # Production roadmap (NEW)

│   ├── PRODUCTION_BLOCKERS.md  # Critical issues (NEW)
│   ├── SECURITY_STATUS.md      # Consolidated security (NEW)
│   └── COMPLIANCE_STATUS.md    # SOC2 tracking (NEW)

├── completed/                 # Archived features (empty)
└── legacy/                    # Old docs
    └── ASYNC_*.md            # 4 async files moved here
```

### 2. Key New Documents

#### PRODUCTION_BLOCKERS.md
- Lists 7 critical issues preventing production use
- Most critical: 142+ `.unwrap()` panic points
- Clear metrics and path to resolution

#### SECURITY_STATUS.md  
- Honest assessment: Grade C+ overall
- Shows what's actually secure vs. what needs work
- Resolves contradictions between audit files

#### COMPLIANCE_STATUS.md
- SOC2 readiness: 0/5 criteria met
- Detailed gap analysis
- 12-month roadmap to compliance

#### ROADMAP.md
- 24-month plan from v0.5.0 to v2.0.0
- Quarterly milestones
- Clear success metrics

### 3. Consolidations Done

#### Async Implementation
- Merged 4 files → ASYNC_IMPLEMENTATION.md
- Found: Implementation incomplete despite claims
- Critical TODOs and missing code generation
- Security work only partially integrated

### 4. Still To Do

- [ ] Consolidate module security files (4 files)
- [ ] Consolidate memory management files  
- [ ] Consolidate generics documentation
- [ ] Move completed features to completed/
- [ ] Create architecture documents
- [ ] Archive remaining legacy files

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Clear Navigation** - README guides to right docs
2. **No Contradictions** - Single source of truth
3. **Production Focus** - PRODUCTION_BLOCKERS shows critical path
4. **Compliance Ready** - SOC2 framework in place
5. **Honest Assessment** - Accurate status without hyperbole

## Next Steps

1. Complete remaining consolidations
2. Archive completed feature docs
3. Update all cross-references
4. Remove redundant legacy files
5. Establish update process

This reorganization provides a solid foundation for tracking Script's path to production readiness and SOC2 compliance.
