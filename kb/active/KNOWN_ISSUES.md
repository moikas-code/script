- Audit logging with 10,000 entry buffer
- Three security levels: strict, standard, relaxed

**AI Integration Impact**:
Script now has a nearly production-ready MCP server providing secure, AI-native code analysis capabilities. This represents a major milestone toward becoming the first truly AI-native programming language.

## 🎯 Minor Issues (Quality of Life)

### 4. Codegen Security Vulnerabilities
**Severity**: HIGH  
**Impact**: Production security concerns  
**Status**: 🔴 OPEN (Documented for implementation)

**Description**: 
Comprehensive security audit of the `src/codegen/` module identified 6 critical security vulnerabilities requiring attention before production deployment.

**Issue Location**: `kb/active/CODEGEN_SECURITY_AUDIT_ISSUE.md`

**Critical Vulnerabilities Identified**:
- Memory safety issues in runtime functions (CVSS 8.1)
- Integer overflow vulnerabilities in monomorphization (CVSS 7.8)
