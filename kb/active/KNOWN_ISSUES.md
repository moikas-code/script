# Known Issues and Limitations

**Last Updated**: 2025-07-10  
**Script Version**: v0.5.0-alpha (actual implementation ~75% complete)

## 🚨 Critical Issues (Production Blockers)

### 1. Test System Completely Broken
**Severity**: CRITICAL  
**Impact**: No CI/CD possible, development quality compromised  
**Status**: 🔴 BLOCKING  

**Details**:
- 66 compilation errors prevent any tests from running
- 299 compiler warnings indicate poor code quality
- No automated testing or quality gates possible
- Development velocity severely impacted

### 2. Implementation Gaps vs Claims
**Severity**: CRITICAL  
**Impact**: Misleading completion status, production readiness overstated  
**Status**: 🔴 BLOCKING  

**Details**:
- 255 TODO/unimplemented!/panic! calls across 35 files
- Security module has unimplemented stubs despite claimed 95% completion
- Debugger shows extensive TODOs despite claimed 90% completion
- Actual completion closer to 70-75% rather than claimed 92%

### 3. Version Inconsistency
**Severity**: HIGH  
**Impact**: Confusion about release status, broken auto-updater  
**Status**: 🔴 OPEN  

**Details**:
- Binary reports v0.3.0 while documentation claims v0.5.0-alpha
- No single source of truth for version information
- Release management compromised

## 🟡 High Priority Issues

### 4. Missing Key Binary Targets
**Severity**: HIGH  
**Impact**: Incomplete tooling ecosystem, missing core features  
**Status**: 🔴 OPEN  

**Details**:
- MCP server binary missing from Cargo.toml despite being key architectural feature
- No standalone debugger binary despite complete debugger module
- Testing framework binary missing despite testing infrastructure

### 5. KB Documentation Inconsistencies
**Severity**: HIGH  
**Impact**: Misleading project status, incorrect completion tracking  
**Status**: 🔴 OPEN  

**Details**:
- Status files show conflicting completion percentages
- Some components marked as "blocked" while claiming completion elsewhere
- Major discrepancy between claimed 92% and actual ~75% completion

## 🔧 Major Issues (Functionality Impaired)

### 1. Error Messages Need Improvement
**Severity**: MEDIUM  
**Impact**: Poor developer experience  
**Status**: 🔴 OPEN

Current issues:
- Generic error messages lack context
- Type mismatch errors don't show expected vs actual
- No suggestions for common mistakes
- Stack traces missing for runtime errors

**Note**: This is about error message quality, not error handling functionality (which is complete).

### 2. REPL Limitations
**Severity**: MEDIUM  
**Impact**: Limited interactive development  
**Status**: 🔴 OPEN

REPL issues:
- Cannot define types in REPL
- Multi-line input is fragile
- No command history persistence
- Cannot import modules (even though module system works)
- State doesn't persist between sessions

## 🎯 Minor Issues (Quality of Life)

### 3. Performance Optimizations Incomplete
**Severity**: LOW  
**Impact**: Suboptimal performance  
**Status**: 🟡 PARTIAL

Areas needing optimization:
- Type checker has O(n²) behavior in some cases → ✅ FIXED: Now O(n log n)
- Pattern matching could use decision trees
- String operations allocate excessively
- No constant folding in optimizer

### 4. Documentation Gaps
**Severity**: LOW  
**Impact**: Learning curve for new users  
**Status**: 🟡 PARTIAL

Missing documentation:
- No comprehensive language reference
- Limited examples for advanced features
- API documentation incomplete
- No performance tuning guide

### 5. Component Integration Gaps
**Severity**: LOW  
**Impact**: Development workflow limitations  
**Status**: 🔴 OPEN

Recently discovered component integration issues:
- **Debugger**: Not mentioned in main status tracking despite 90% completion
- **LSP**: Functional but missing from roadmap (85% complete)
- **Manuscript**: Package manager working but undocumented (80% complete)
- **Security Module**: Production-ready but not in status (95% complete)
- **Metaprogramming**: Core features working but not tracked (70% complete)
- **Documentation Generator**: Functional but not integrated (70% complete)

- Need to recalibrate roadmap and expectations
- Focus must shift to core implementation completion

### Development Velocity Impact
- **Negative**: Broken test system blocks quality assurance
- **Negative**: 255 implementation gaps require significant work
- **Challenge**: Need to rebuild developer confidence
- **Challenge**: Must complete core features before polish
