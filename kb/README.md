# Knowledge Base

Welcome to your knowledge base!

## Structure
- `docs/` - Documentation files
- `notes/` - Meeting notes and quick thoughts  
- `references/` - Reference materials and specs
- `guides/` - How-to guides and tutorials
- `archive/` - Archived content

## Important Distinction: kb/ vs src/doc/

This knowledge base (`kb/`) serves a different purpose than the `src/doc/` directory:

- **`kb/` (this directory)**: Internal development documentation
  - Tracks implementation status, known issues, and development notes
  - Used by developers working on the Script language compiler
  - Integrated with MCP tools for project management
  - Contains markdown files about compiler architecture and development

- **`src/doc/`**: Documentation generator for Script language
  - Generates HTML documentation from Script source code comments
  - Parses `///` and `/** */` doc comments from `.script` files
  - Creates user-facing API documentation
  - Used by Script language users to document their code

Both systems are complementary and serve distinct audiences.
