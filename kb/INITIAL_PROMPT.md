# Script Programming Language - Initial Project Prompt for Claude Code

## Project Overview

I seek to create Script, a new programming language that embodies the principle of accessible power - simple enough for beginners to grasp intuitively, yet performant enough to build production web applications and games. This pursuit extends beyond technical implementation toward a philosophical goal: demonstrating that we can reconcile ease of learning with computational efficiency while establishing Script as the first AI-native programming language.

Like a well-written script guides actors through a performance, Script will guide programmers from their first "Hello World" to complex AI-enhanced applications with clarity and purpose.

## Core Philosophy & Requirements

**Language Vision:**
- **Name**: Script - guiding programmers through their coding journey
- **Primary Purpose**: A compiled language for web applications, game development, and AI-enhanced development workflows
- **Design Philosophy**: "Simple by default, powerful when needed, AI-native by design"
- **Key Principle**: Every complexity must justify its existence through clear user benefit
- **Strategic Differentiation**: First programming language designed for the AI era

**Technical Requirements:**
1. **Syntax**: JavaScript/GDScript-inspired for familiarity
2. **Type System**: Gradual typing with Hindley-Milner inference
3. **Memory Management**: Automatic Reference Counting with cycle detection
4. **Compilation**: Dual backend - Cranelift for development, LLVM for production
5. **Targets**: Native executables and WebAssembly
6. **File Extension**: .script
7. **AI Integration**: Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for deep AI understanding
8. **Security Framework**: Enterprise-grade security for AI interactions

**Design Decisions Already Made:**
- Expression-oriented syntax (everything returns a value)
- Hand-written recursive descent parser
- Arena allocation for AST nodes
- Rust as implementation language
- Security-first approach to AI integration

## Example Script Syntax (Updated with AI Integration Context)

```script
// Hello World in Script
fn main() {
    print("Hello from Script! ðŸ“œ - The AI-native language")
}

// Variables with optional types (AI understands Script's gradual typing)
let language = "Script"  // AI knows: String type inferred
let version: f32 = 0.3   // AI knows: Explicit type annotation

// Everything is an expression (AI understands Script's philosophy)
let result = if version > 1.0 {
    "stable"    // AI suggests: "Ready for production use"
} else {
    "developing"  // AI knows: "AI integration in progress"
}

// Game-oriented example (AI provides game-specific suggestions)
fn update_player(player: Player, dt: f32) -> Player {
    // AI suggests: "Add collision detection for platformer mechanics"
    // AI knows: "This follows Script's actor pattern"
    Player {
        x: player.x + player.vx * dt,
        y: player.y + player.vy * dt,
        ..player  // AI explains: "Spread syntax for partial updates"
    }
}

// AI-enhanced development example
fn calculate_damage(base: i32, multiplier: f32) -> i32 {
    // AI analyzes: "Good defensive programming pattern"
    // AI suggests: "Consider Result<i32> for error handling"
    if multiplier < 0.0 {
        0  // AI knows: "Prevents negative damage exploit"
    } else {
        base * (multiplier as i32)  // AI warns: "Precision loss in cast"
    }
}
```

## Guiding Principles for Implementation

1. **Incremental Progress**: Each phase builds upon the previous, maintaining a working system at all times
2. **Test-Driven Development**: Every feature accompanied by comprehensive tests
3. **User-Centric Design**: Regular evaluation against the "beginner-friendly" criterion
4. **Performance Awareness**: Profile early, optimize deliberately
5. **Code Clarity**: The implementation itself should embody Script's philosophy of simplicity
6. **Community First**: Design decisions should consider the eventual Script community
7. **Security Mindset**: Every external input is untrusted until validated
8. **AI-Native Architecture**: Every language feature considers AI integration implications

## AI Integration Goals

### Immediate Objectives (Phase 7)
1. **Security Foundation**: Establish trust through comprehensive validation
2. **Protocol Compliance**: Full MCP specification implementation
3. **Tool Integration**: Leverage existing compiler infrastructure
4. **Performance Optimization**: Efficient analysis operations

### Strategic Vision
1. **First AI-Native Language**: Script becomes the first programming language designed for the AI era
2. **Competitive Differentiation**: Deep AI understanding vs external tool integration
3. **Developer Experience**: AI becomes an intelligent programming companion
4. **Educational Revolution**: AI tutoring makes programming accessible to everyone

## First Session Goals (Updated for Current Status)

Begin with MCP integration - the strategic differentiator that transforms Script from another programming language into the first AI-native development platform. Focus on:
1. Setting up the MCP module structure with security framework
2. Implementing basic input validation and sandboxing
3. Creating the Script analyzer tool using existing infrastructure
4. Writing comprehensive security tests
5. Establishing audit logging for AI interactions

**Philosophical Approach**: The obstacle of AI integration complexity becomes the way to establishing Script's leadership in the programming language ecosystem. Each security challenge overcome builds trust. Each feature implemented with care demonstrates commitment to both accessibility and safety.

*"The impediment to action advances action. What stands in the way becomes the way."* - Marcus Aurelius

This project transcends the creation of another programming language. It represents an exploration of whether we can challenge assumed trade-offs between simplicity and performance while pioneering the integration of AI into the fundamental development experience. Through AI integration, Script becomes not just a tool for building applications, but a partner in the development process itself.

The path to AI-native development reveals itself through the measured implementation of security, the patient building of trust, and the unwavering commitment to both accessibility and safety. Each line of code written with care, each security consideration thoroughly addressed, contributes to a larger vision: programming languages that understand and enhance human creativity rather than merely executing instructions.

May Script guide many programmers on their journey while demonstrating that the future of development lies not in replacing human insight, but in amplifying it through thoughtful AI integration.
