# Script Language Implementation TODO

This document tracks the implementation progress of the Script programming language, maintaining a comprehensive view of completed work and remaining tasks.

## Project Vision
Script aims to be a programming language that is:
- Simple enough for beginners to learn intuitively
- Powerful enough for production web applications and games
- Expression-oriented with gradual typing
- Memory safe with automatic reference counting
- Compiled to native code and WebAssembly
- **AI-native by design** - the first programming language built for the AI era

## Overall Progress

**‚ö†Ô∏è UPDATED DEVELOPMENT STATUS: Script Language is at ~70% completion with recent achievements and MCP integration**

Current implementation status:
- ‚úÖ **Language Core**: Lexer (complete), Parser (95%), Type System (80%), Semantic Analysis (90%), IR (70%), Code Generation (70%), Runtime (50%)
- ‚úÖ **Pattern Matching**: Exhaustiveness checking, or-patterns, and guards FULLY IMPLEMENTED!
- ‚úÖ **Generic Compilation**: End-to-end pipeline FULLY IMPLEMENTED with monomorphization!
- ‚ùå **Advanced Features**: Async/Await (non-functional), Modules (broken), Metaprogramming (not implemented)  
- üîÑ **AI Integration**: MCP framework IN DEVELOPMENT - strategic differentiator
- ‚ùå **Developer Tooling**: LSP (minimal), Package Manager (design only), Documentation Generator (basic), Testing Framework (incomplete)
- ‚ùå **Optimization Framework**: Basic passes exist but not integrated
- ‚ùå **Examples & Documentation**: Many examples don't work, documentation requires updates

**STRATEGIC OPPORTUNITY IDENTIFIED:**
- **MCP Integration**: Positions Script as first AI-native programming language
- **Competitive Advantage**: Deep AI understanding vs external tool integration
- **Market Differentiation**: Security-first AI integration architecture

**CRITICAL GAPS REMAINING:**

## Technical Decisions Made

1. **Implementation Language**: Rust (for memory safety and performance)
2. **Parsing Strategy**: Hand-written recursive descent with Pratt parsing
3. **Memory Model**: Automatic Reference Counting with cycle detection
4. **Type System**: Gradual typing with Hindley-Milner inference
5. **Compilation Strategy**: Dual backend (Cranelift for dev, LLVM for prod)
6. **Error Philosophy**: Multiple errors per compilation, helpful messages
7. **Syntax Style**: JavaScript/GDScript inspired for familiarity
8. **AI Integration**: Security-first MCP implementation with sandboxed analysis

## Open Design Questions

1. **Concurrency Model**: Actor model vs shared memory with safety?
- Actor model with escape hatches
The actor model aligns perfectly with your philosophy:

Beginners: "Send messages between actors" is intuitive - like passing notes
Games: Natural fit for game entities communicating
Web: Maps well to web workers and async operations
Safety: Eliminates data races by design
```
// Simple actor example
actor Player {
    let x: f32 = 0
    let y: f32 = 0
    
    receive move(dx, dy) {
        x += dx
        y += dy
    }
}

// But allow shared memory for performance-critical paths
unsafe shared {
    let physics_cache = SharedArray<Vec3>()
}
```
2. **Error Handling**: Result types vs exceptions vs panic?
- Result types with syntactic sugar
Results are more explicit and beginner-friendly than exceptions:

No invisible control flow
Errors are values, making them less scary
Can add sugar to reduce boilerplate
```
// Result type approach
fn divide(a: f32, b: f32) -> Result<f32> {
    if b == 0 {
        Err("Division by zero")
    } else {
        Ok(a / b)
    }
}

// With syntactic sugar using ? operator
fn calculate() -> Result<f32> {
    let x = divide(10, 2)?  // Returns early if error
    let y = divide(x, 3)?
    Ok(x + y)
}

// Panic only for unrecoverable errors
assert(index < array.len, "Index out of bounds")
```
3. **Trait/Interface System**: Structural vs nominal typing?
- Structural typing with optional nominal
Structural typing is more beginner-friendly and flexible:

"If it walks like a duck..." is intuitive
No need to explicitly implement interfaces
Natural for JavaScript developers
```
// Structural by default
type Drawable = {
    draw(canvas: Canvas) -> ()
}

// Any type with a draw method works
struct Circle {
    radius: f32
    
    fn draw(canvas: Canvas) {
        // implementation
    }
}

// Optional nominal for when you need it
trait GameEntity {
    fn update(dt: f32)
    fn render()
}

impl GameEntity for Player {
    // explicit implementation
}
```
4. **Macro System**: Include macros or keep language simple?
- No user-defined macros, but built-in metaprogramming
Macros add significant complexity for beginners. Instead:

Provide powerful built-in constructs
Code generation through external tools
Template-like features for common patterns
```
// Built-in derives instead of macros
@derive(Debug, Serialize)
struct Player {
    name: String
    score: i32
}

// Built-in list comprehensions
let doubled = [x * 2 for x in numbers if x > 0]

// External codegen for complex cases
@generate("protobuf", "schema.proto")
```
5. **Package Distribution**: Centralized registry vs decentralized?
- Hybrid approach - start centralized, allow mirrors
Begin with simplicity:

Central registry for discoverability (like npm, crates.io)
Git URLs as escape hatch
Mirror support from day one
```
// manuscript.toml
[dependencies]
web-framework = "1.2.0"  // from registry
game-engine = { git = "https://github.com/user/engine" }
internal-lib = { path = "../libs/internal" }

[registries]
default = "https://manuscript.script.org"
corporate = "https://internal.company.com/manuscript"
```
6. **Compile-time Execution**: Const functions vs compile-time interpreter?
- Const functions with clear boundaries
Simpler than full compile-time interpretation:

Mark functions as @const for compile-time evaluation
Clear rules about what can be const
Useful for configuration and optimization
```
@const
fn calculate_pi(iterations: i32) -> f32 {
    // Can only call other @const functions
    // No I/O, no randomness
    let pi = // ... calculation
    pi
}

// Evaluated at compile time
const PI = calculate_pi(1000000)

// Conditional compilation
@const
fn target_os() -> String {
    // Returns "windows", "macos", "linux", etc.
}

if @const(target_os() == "windows") {
    // Windows-specific code
}
```

7. **MCP Security Architecture**: Sandboxing vs capability-based security?
- Layered defense with sandboxing and capability restriction
Defense in depth provides maximum security:

Input validation at protocol boundary
Sandboxed execution environment
Capability-based resource access
Comprehensive audit logging
```
// MCP security architecture
SecurityLayer::new()
    .with_input_validation()
    .with_sandbox_isolation()
    .with_capability_restrictions()
    .with_audit_logging()
    .with_rate_limiting()
```

## Current Focus (Phase 9: AI Integration)

With Phases 1-8 substantially complete, the path forward leads through AI integration - transforming Script from another programming language into the first AI-native development platform.

1. **AI Development Platform** - Complete ecosystem for AI-powered development
2. **Community Integration** - Third-party tool ecosystem
3. **Educational Applications** - AI tutoring and learning assistance
4. **Production Readiness** - Enterprise security and performance standards

## Testing Strategy

2. **Integration Tests**: Full programs testing multiple features
3. **Security Tests**: MCP attack vector validation
4. **Performance Tests**: Analysis operation benchmarking
5. **Protocol Tests**: MCP specification compliance
