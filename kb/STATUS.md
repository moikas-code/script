**Recent Philosophical Victory**: The entire generic compilation pipeline now works end-to-end. From parsing through monomorphization to code generation, generic functions are fully operational with smart deduplication achieving 43% efficiency. Generic structs and enums now parse correctly with full AST support.

```script
// These expressions now parse, compile, and execute:
fn identity<T>(x: T) -> T { x }
fn sort<T: Ord + Clone>(items: Vec<T>) -> Vec<T> { items.sort(); items }
fn map<T, U>(items: Vec<T>, f: fn(T) -> U) -> Vec<U> { /* impl */ }

// New tuple and reference types also parse correctly:
let point: (i32, i32) = (10, 20)
let data: &mut (string, bool) = &mut ("hello", true)
fn swap<T, U>(pair: (T, U)) -> (U, T) { (pair.1, pair.0) }

// Generic structs and enums now parse successfully:
struct Box<T> { value: T }
enum Option<T> { Some(T), None }
struct Pair<A, B> { first: A, second: B }
```

**Remaining Parser Challenges**:

match response {
    Ok(data) => process_data(data),
    Err(NetworkError::Timeout) => retry_with_backoff(),
    Err(e) => log_error_and_continue(e)
    // Compiler ensures all cases are covered
