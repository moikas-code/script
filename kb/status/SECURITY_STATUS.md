- **Resource Bounds**: Iteration, recursion, and specialization limits

### 2. Runtime Security  
- **Memory Safety**: Array bounds checking and null pointer protection
- **Type Safety**: Field access validation and type checking
- **Async Safety**: Memory corruption prevention in async operations
- **Error Handling**: Secure error propagation and recovery

### 3. Security Testing
- **Attack Vector Coverage**: All known attack vectors tested
- **DoS Simulation**: Resource exhaustion attack testing
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Automated security validation
- **Integration Testing**: End-to-end security validation

## Security Configuration

### Production Environment (Secure Defaults)
```rust
let limits = ResourceLimits::production();
// - max_iterations: 100,000
// - phase_timeout: 60 seconds  
// - total_timeout: 180 seconds
// - max_memory: 1GB
// - max_recursion_depth: 1,000
// - max_specializations: 1,000
// - max_work_queue_size: 10,000
```

### Development Environment (Permissive)
```rust
let limits = ResourceLimits::development();
// - 2x production limits for development flexibility
```

### High-Security Environment (Restrictive)
```rust
let limits = ResourceLimits::custom()
    .max_iterations(1_000)
    .phase_timeout(Duration::from_secs(5))
    .max_memory_bytes(10 * 1024 * 1024) // 10MB
    .build()?;
```

}

// Security violation handling
match compilation_result {
    Err(Error::SecurityViolation(msg)) => {
