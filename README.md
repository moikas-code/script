## Language Features

### Modern Syntax

Script harmonizes functional and imperative programming approaches:

```script
// Functions demonstrate first-class status
fn fibonacci(n: i32) -> i32 {
    if n <= 1 { n } else { fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2) }
}

// Pattern matching with comprehensive safety
enum Result<T, E> { Ok(T), Err(E) }
enum NetworkError { Timeout, ConnectionFailed, AuthError }

match response {
    Ok(data) => process_success(data),
    Err(NetworkError::Timeout) => retry_request(),
    Err(NetworkError::ConnectionFailed) => reconnect(),
    Err(NetworkError::AuthError) => reauthenticate()
    // Compiler ensures all cases covered - no runtime surprises!
}

// Iterator chains with functional elegance
let processed = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    .map(|x| x * x)
    .filter(|x| x > 10)
    .collect()

// Async operations (implementation progressing)
async fn fetch_data(url: string) -> Result<string> {
    let response = await http_get(url)
    response.text()
}
```

### Type System Excellence

Script provides sophisticated typing with gradual adoption:

```script
// Type inference operates automatically
let name = "Alice"          // Inferred as string
let age = 30               // Inferred as i32
let scores = [95, 87, 92]  // Inferred as [i32]

// Optional annotations enhance clarity
fn calculate_average(numbers: [f64]) -> f64 {
    let sum: f64 = numbers.iter().sum()
    sum / numbers.len() as f64
}

// Generics with complete type inference
struct Box<T> { value: T }
enum Option<T> { Some(T), None }

// Type inference works seamlessly
let int_box = Box { value: 42 }        // Inferred as Box<i32>
let str_box = Box { value: "hello" }   // Inferred as Box<string>
let opt = Option::Some(3.14)           // Inferred as Option<f64>

// Generic functions with trait bounds
fn sort<T: Ord + Clone>(items: Vec<T>) -> Vec<T> {
    let mut sorted = items.clone()
    sorted.sort()
    sorted
}
```

### Memory Management Excellence

Script employs automatic reference counting with **production-grade cycle detection**:

```script
// Automatic memory management with cycle detection
let list = LinkedList::new()
list.push("Hello")
list.push("World")
// Memory freed automatically when list scope ends

// Bacon-Rajan cycle detection handles complex cycles
struct Node {
    value: i32,
    next: Option<Rc<Node>>,
    parent: Option<Rc<Node>>  // Cycles detected and collected automatically
}
```

**Memory Safety Features**:
- ✅ **Production-grade cycle detection** using Bacon-Rajan algorithm
- ✅ **Type registry** for safe type recovery and downcasting  
- ✅ **Incremental collection** with configurable work limits
- ✅ **Thread-safe concurrent collection** support

## AI-Native Development - Revolutionary Capability

### The First AI-Native Programming Language

Script pioneers deep AI integration through Model Context Protocol (MCP) implementation:

```script
// AI understands Script's semantics, not just syntax
let player = Player::new("Hero", 100)
// AI suggests: "Add collision detection for platformer mechanics"
// AI recognizes: "This follows Script's actor pattern for games"
// AI recommends: "Consider health bounds checking for game balance"
```

**Revolutionary AI Capabilities**:
- **Semantic Understanding**: AI comprehends Script's type system and design patterns
- **Context-Aware Assistance**: Suggestions based on game development, web apps, or educational context
- **Secure Integration**: Enterprise-grade security prevents AI exploitation
- **Educational Partnership**: AI becomes an intelligent programming instructor

### MCP Integration Architecture

```rust
// AI tools connect to Script's intelligence
AI_Assistant → Script MCP Server → Deep Language Analysis
             → Security Validation
             → Context-Aware Suggestions
             → Real-time Code Understanding
```

**Security-First Approach**:
- Comprehensive input validation prevents malicious code execution
- Sandboxed analysis environment protects system integrity
- Audit logging maintains complete interaction transparency
- Rate limiting prevents resource exhaustion

**Current Implementation Status**: 🔄 Security framework designed, MCP server implementation in progress (15% complete)

## Integration & Embedding

### Embed in Rust Applications

```rust
use script::{Runtime, RuntimeConfig};

fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let mut runtime = Runtime::new(RuntimeConfig::default())?;
    
    // Register native functions for interoperability
    runtime.register_function("log", |args| {
        println!("Script reports: {}", args[0]);
        Ok(script::Value::Null)
    })?;
    
    // Execute Script code with confidence
    let result = runtime.execute_string(r#"
        fn greet(name: string) -> string {
            log("Greeting " + name)
            "Hello, " + name + "!"
        }
        
        greet("World")
    "#)?;
    
    println!("Result: {}", result);
    Ok(())
}
```

### Foreign Function Interface (Planned)

```script
// Load and utilize C libraries
let math_lib = ffi.load("libm.so")
math_lib.declare("sin", ffi.double, [ffi.double])
math_lib.declare("cos", ffi.double, [ffi.double])

let angle = 3.14159 / 4.0
let sine = math_lib.sin(angle)
let cosine = math_lib.cos(angle)

print("sin(π/4) = " + sine)
print("cos(π/4) = " + cosine)
```

### Web and Game Development Vision

```script
// Web server with async support (implementation developing)
async fn handle_request(request: HttpRequest) -> HttpResponse {
    let user_id = request.params.get("id")
    let user = await database.find_user(user_id)
    
    HttpResponse::json(user)
}

// Game development with integrated graphics
fn game_loop() {
    let player = Player::new(100, 100)
    let enemies = spawn_enemies(5)
    
    while game.running {
        // Update game state systematically
        player.update(input.get_state())
        enemies.forEach(|enemy| enemy.update())
        
        // Render frame with precision
        graphics.clear(Color::BLACK)
        player.draw()
        enemies.forEach(|enemy| enemy.draw())
        graphics.present()
        
        await sleep(16) // 60 FPS target
    }
}
```
