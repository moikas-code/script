# Script Programming Language - Initial Project Prompt for Claude Code

## Project Overview

I seek to create Script, a new programming language that embodies the principle of accessible power - simple enough for beginners to grasp intuitively, yet performant enough to build production web applications and games. This is not merely a technical exercise, but a philosophical pursuit: can we reconcile ease of learning with computational efficiency?

Like a well-written script guides actors through a performance, Script will guide programmers from their first "Hello World" to complex applications with clarity and purpose.

## Core Philosophy & Requirements

**Language Vision:**
- **Name**: Script - guiding programmers through their coding journey
- **Primary Purpose**: A compiled language for web applications and game development
- **Design Philosophy**: "Simple by default, powerful when needed"
- **Key Principle**: Every complexity must justify its existence through clear user benefit

**Technical Requirements:**
1. **Syntax**: JavaScript/GDScript-inspired for familiarity
2. **Type System**: Gradual typing with Hindley-Milner inference
3. **Memory Management**: Automatic Reference Counting with cycle detection
4. **Compilation**: Dual backend - Cranelift for development, LLVM for production
5. **Targets**: Native executables and WebAssembly
6. **File Extension**: .script

**Design Decisions Already Made:**
- Expression-oriented syntax (everything returns a value)
- Hand-written recursive descent parser
- Arena allocation for AST nodes
- Rust as implementation language

## Example Script Syntax (proposed)

```script
// Hello World in Script
fn main() {
    print("Hello from Script! ðŸ“œ")
}

// Variables with optional types
let language = "Script"
let version: f32 = 0.1

// Everything is an expression
let result = if version > 1.0 {
    "stable"
} else {
    "experimental"
}

// Game-oriented example
fn update_player(player: Player, dt: f32) -> Player {
    Player {
        x: player.x + player.vx * dt,
        y: player.y + player.vy * dt,
        ..player  // spread syntax
    }
}
```

## Guiding Principles for Implementation

1. **Incremental Progress**: Each phase builds upon the previous, maintaining a working system at all times
2. **Test-Driven Development**: Every feature accompanied by comprehensive tests
3. **User-Centric Design**: Regular evaluation against the "beginner-friendly" criterion
4. **Performance Awareness**: Profile early, optimize deliberately
5. **Code Clarity**: The implementation itself should embody Script's philosophy of simplicity
6. **Community First**: Design decisions should consider the eventual Script community

## First Session Goals

Begin with the lexer - the foundation upon which all else rests. Focus on:
1. Setting up the Rust project structure for "script-lang"
2. Implementing basic token types
3. Creating a simple scanner that can tokenize arithmetic expressions
4. Writing tests for edge cases
5. Creating a simple main.rs that can tokenize a .script file

Remember: The journey of creating Script begins with a single token. Each small step forward is progress toward the larger vision. Like a carefully written script guides a performance, our language will guide programmers through their coding journey with clarity and purpose.

*"The impediment to action advances action. What stands in the way becomes the way."* - Marcus Aurelius

This project is not merely about creating a programming language; it is about discovering whether we can challenge the assumed trade-offs between simplicity and performance. Proceed with patience, clarity of purpose, and acceptance that the path will reveal itself through the walking of it.

May Script guide many programmers on their journey.
